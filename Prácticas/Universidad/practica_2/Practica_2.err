 Boolean operation involves meshed Area 1.  This operation may create    
 new entities without elements and could contaminate the database.  The  
 recommended approach is to perform Boolean operations only on unmeshed  
 entities.

 Boolean operation involves meshed Area 2.  This operation may create
